# SENSORLESS-TOILET-

##Nowadays we’re using e-toilets in rural and urban environments providing sanitation solutions to people on the move. But especially we’re using toilet sheets and disposed freely in floor causes hygienic problems and creates an dissatisfied to use the toilets where in not maintaining clean. In this case we’re introducing sensor less toilets with waste disposal system for preventing this problems to deployed in public toilets, ensuring efficiency, sustainability, and user satisfaction.##

##This projects works based on the embedded system by using ATMEGA328 microcontroller motherboard in hardware and includes Embedded C programming in Arduino IDE software. and it contains five components that works in this system such as
PCB modified ATMEGA328 motherboard.
Solenoid valve for flushing purpose.
Solenoid lock for door locking purpose.
DC 12V LED (Red, Green) light for indication purpose.
Coin collecting machine for token purpose.
Vacuum pump system for disposal of toilet paper waste. 
Calling bell switch for unlocking purpose fixed in inside.##
